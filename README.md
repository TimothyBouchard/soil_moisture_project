# soil_moisture_project

4/16/2023 
I'v been working on this project for about a month now, my goal is to create a mobile application that can help users effectivly grow a garden.
I have uploaded everything i have devloped thus far, all the data was created by me from surching the internet. The code was also devloped by me as well. 

So far the only thing i have somwhat completed is the main AI chatbot, this is a bot that i want to implament into the application that would make the user feel like the application is personalized to them, or their garden. 

goal 1: are going to be to make the chatbot more personalble and relateable.

goal 2:
i would like to implment a weather api get request to add weather data into the application. Im hoping i can find this data online somwhere, if not i have to create my own data set which i already have started the process in doing so, i have a Arduino micro controller that can monitor soil moisture, temp, and humidity levels, im having issues saving the data though, i have an sd card reader that i could save the data too but its not working. i tried saving the data to a google doc. but im having issues with that as well. If i cant find soil moisture, and weather pattern data online i may have to continue where i left off in making the device.
